		<h1 id='title'>The Long View</h1>
		<p id='about'>The way we consume today's avalanche of news -- quickly and without significant context -- can leave us with the impression that the news is <em>new</em>, that the current crisis is a historical aberration from the ways things have always been. <strong>The Long View</strong> attempts to correct that perspective by surfacing historical news articles that are similar in content to the one a user is reading.</p>
		<p>Through natural language processing, <strong>The Long View</strong> collects collocations and named entities from an article, creates pairs of search terms from these significant phrases, and then searches the entire New York Times online archive for similar articles.  The results are visualized both by date and by content area.</p>
		<p><strong>The Long View</strong> fulfills both the need of understanding the changing historical perspectives of a story, as well as introducing a novel means of content discovery.</p>
		<h3>Using The Long View</h3>
		<p>The Long View is a bookmarklet that inserts a timeline to the left of the article you're currently reading.<p>
		<p>When viewing the tool, you can see articles by time period by hovering over the decade areas; you can view articles by topic by clicking on one of the search term boxes at the bottom of the screen. Scrolling over the article title reveals a summary, and clicking on the summary will take you to the full article.</p>
